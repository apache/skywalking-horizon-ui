/**
 * Incident merging for the alarms surface.
 *
 * OAP emits one `AlarmMessage` per firing — a rule that re-fires
 * after its silence period creates a new row. From the operator's
 * triage perspective these N rows are ONE incident on (entity, rule),
 * not N separate alarms. The wire `id` field is
 * `<entityBase64>.<ruleNumber>` and is stable across firings of the
 * same rule on the same entity, so it's a free incident key.
 *
 * Merging rules:
 *   - Group `AlarmMessage[]` by `id`.
 *   - Sort each group by `startTime` ascending — the LAST entry is
 *     the most recent firing.
 *   - The incident's state is `firing` when the latest entry's
 *     `recoveryTime` is null, else `recovered`. The state of earlier
 *     entries doesn't matter; only the tail decides.
 *   - Latest entry's `message` / `name` / `scope` / `layerKey` /
 *     `tags` / `snapshot` represent the incident — those are what
 *     the operator sees in the row.
 *
 * Count semantics (per the spec):
 *   - Page totals + topbar badge + per-layer chips count ACTIVE
 *     incidents (state === 'firing'). A fully-recovered incident
 *     contributes nothing — the operator's "what's on fire right
 *     now?" view stays clean.
 *   - The Timeline chart keeps every individual event so the
 *     fire-then-recovered pattern is still visible; events are split
 *     by state into separate series (firing red, recovered green).

 *     into ONE merged row showing "triggered N× · recovered". They
 *     don't count toward active totals, so a single summary line is
 *     enough for the operator to know "this happened and cleared".
 *
